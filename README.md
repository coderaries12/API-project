This is my first full-stack development project.In module-4 I designed the backend routes and database using seqelize3 of this project and now in current module-5 develop the front-end part of this project using react and redux.In front-end, completed 4 CRUD operations of SPOT(read,create,edit n delete) and also completed completed two CRUD operations of review (create n delete).To give website look similar to Airbnb, done css styling also.So first there is landing page in which oyu can view all spots.Then nav-right side there is user menu button.There are two demo user button options also to enter the website and check the features.You can create spot, edit n delete spot if you are authentic user.If you click on particular spot then you can also see the reviews of user of that corresponding spot.reviews can alos be added n delete if you are authentic user.
